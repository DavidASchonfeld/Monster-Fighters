# Monster Fighters

### Description
Starting in Spring 2017, I started working on this videogame as a personal project. I am still working on it today.

### What is Monster Fighters?
A platformer/fighting video game.

[Screenshots will be uploaded soon]

### What technologies are you using to build it?
I am using TypeScript (typed superset of JavaScript) and BabylonJS (game engine).

### Why isn't the code uploaded on Github?
Once the game is finished, I plan on selling it. Thus, I do not want to publish its source code.

### Where can I find more information about this project?
Feel free to contact me at: davidaschonfeld@gmail.com
